Summary:
We are making a webapp that allows users to find the best deal on restaurants and/or hotels within a certain radius of a location, using the information given by the TripAdvisor API.

What defines a "good deal," is defined by the restaurants deviation from the linear regression analysis of the restaurant's rating vs. price level. If a restaurant is a good deal, it's actual rating will be above the estimated rating using this line. Using the deviations for the restaurants, we ranked in order which ones offered the best deals and displayed them to the user.
